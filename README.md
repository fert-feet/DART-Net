# DART-Net

## Description

DART-Net is a novel deep learning framework designed for **high-precision rainfall intensity estimation using audio signals captured by existing surveillance infrastructure**. Traditional rainfall measurement methods often face limitations in spatial coverage, cost, or real-time capability. Our approach leverages the ubiquitous nature of surveillance cameras to provide a cost-effective and readily deployable alternative.
